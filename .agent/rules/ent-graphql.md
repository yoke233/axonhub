# Ent And GraphQL Rules

## Ent

1. If you change any Ent schema or GraphQL schema, run `make generate`.
2. If you add or update a struct used by GraphQL objects, update the mapping in `gqlgen.yml`.
3. Use `enttest.NewEntClient(t, \"sqlite3\", \"file:ent?mode=memory&_fk=0\")` for Ent tests.
4. Do not edit `ent.graphql` directly; add GraphQL schema in the appropriate non-generated schema file.

## GraphQL

1. Add or change fields by editing `*.graphql` schema files first, then regenerate code with `make generate`.
2. In generated resolver files, only edit generated method bodies. Do not add custom helpers, types, or methods outside those bodies.
3. After running `make generate`, implement any newly required resolvers under `internal/server/gql/`.
4. Prefer GraphQL-side filtering inputs instead of moving filtering logic to the frontend.
5. If a Go field uses a string enum type, prefer a GraphQL `enum` plus `gqlgen.yml` mapping instead of GraphQL `String` with manual conversions.
6. For object or input fields backed by the same Go struct, prefer schema and `gqlgen.yml` mappings that let gqlgen bind directly before adding manual field resolvers.
7. When adding, renaming, or removing any GraphQL field, update the full request/response chain in the same task:
   - update the GraphQL schema in `*.graphql`
   - update both output `type` and input `input` when applicable
   - run `make generate`
   - update all affected frontend GraphQL operations, including mutations that send the field and queries that read it
   - update list/detail/bulk operations that return the same object shape when the UI depends on that field
   - verify create/edit forms can both submit and echo the field back correctly
8. Do not stop after only updating local TypeScript schema, frontend form state, or backend Go structs when the field is delivered through GraphQL.
9. **Adding nested object fields**: When adding a nested object field (e.g., `settings.rateLimit`):
   - Define both Input type (e.g., `ChannelRateLimitInput`) and Output type (e.g., `ChannelRateLimit`) in the GraphQL schema
   - Add the field to both the Input type (e.g., `ChannelSettingsInput`) and Output type (e.g., `ChannelSettings`)
   - Add type mappings in `gqlgen.yml` for both Input and Output types to map to the same Go struct
   - Update frontend GraphQL queries to include the new field
   - Run `make generate` to regenerate code
   - Example workflow:
     ```graphql
     # 1. Define types in axonhub.graphql
     input ChannelRateLimitInput {
       rpm: Int
       tpm: Int
     }
     type ChannelRateLimit {
       rpm: Int
       tpm: Int
     }

     # 2. Add to both Input and Output types
     input ChannelSettingsInput {
       # ... existing fields
       rateLimit: ChannelRateLimitInput
     }
     type ChannelSettings {
       # ... existing fields
       rateLimit: ChannelRateLimit
     }
     ```
     ```yaml
     # 3. Add mappings in gqlgen.yml
     ChannelRateLimit:
       model:
         - github.com/looplj/axonhub/internal/objects.ChannelRateLimit
     ChannelRateLimitInput:
       model:
         - github.com/looplj/axonhub/internal/objects.ChannelRateLimit
     ```

## Schema Changes

1. Do not write manual migration SQL files for normal schema changes.
2. Update `internal/ent/schema/*.go`, run `make generate`, and let Ent-managed migrations handle the rest.
